              <h2 ><b>Overview</b></h2>
              <p>Conversational systems have improved dramatically recently and are gaining adoption in industries such as e-commerce, banking, finance and real estate to name a few.
                 Although there is a lot of reserach done in developing conversational systems spanning areas such as dialogue systems, NLP, NLU, HCI, search and recommender systems; there are additional challenges when a product is created based on conversational systems and deployed to real world users. Research from different
                 areas come together when conversational systems are put in practice along with unique and additional challenges.
                 This workshop aims to bring researchers and practitioners together to discuss issues, learnings, challenges and
                 research in productization of the conversational systems and their deployment to the real world.<br><br>
                 We invite quality research contributions, position and opinion papers addressing relevant challenges in the domain
                 of conversational systems. We invite submission of papers and posters of two to ten pages (including references),
                 representing original research, preliminary research results, proposals for new work, position and opinion papers.<br><br>
                
                 This workshop is a half day workshop taking place on ,  <b>Aug 24, 2020</b> in conjunction with KDD 2020, Virtual Conference. <br><br>

                     In this talk, we survey the finance ecosystem and the history of chat and dialog technology used for trading. We discuss the importance of conversation modeling in assisting traders and in tracking compliance. Then, we discuss some complexities of modeling trading conversations, as well as our work on entity recognition and slot filling, intent recognition and conversation disentanglement.

                  <p>
                   <b>Abstract:</b></font></a><br>
                     Mapping textual mentions to entities in a knowledge graph is a key step in assistants, called Named Entity Disambiguation (NED). A key challenge in NED is generalizing to rarely seen (tail) entities. Traditionally NED uses hand-tuned patterns to capture rare, but reliable, signals. Hand-built features make it challenging to deploy and maintain NED--especially in multiple locales. While at Apple in 2018, we built a self-supervised system for NED that was deployed in a handful of locales and that improved performance of the assistant significantly. However, due to the fog of production, it was unclear what aspects of these models were most valuable. Motivated by this experience, we built Bootleg, a clean-slate, open-source, self-supervised system to improve tail performance using a simple transformer-based architecture. Bootleg improves tail generalization through a new inverse regularization scheme to favor more generalizable signals automatically. Bootleg achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the three major NED benchmarks by up to 3.3 F1 points, and it improves performance over BERT baselines on tail slices by 50.1 F1 points. Some end-to-end experience using Bootleg in knowledge seeking queries will be described.
<br><br>
                     Bootleg is open-source at http://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/bootleg/

                   <b>Abstract:</b></font></a><br>
                     Advances in conversational technologies including speech recognition,
                     natural language understanding, dialog management, language generation
                     and text-to-speech synthesis have accelerated the adoption of
                     conversational systems by businesses and consumers alike for everyday
                     tasks. Even so, architecting and engineering a complex
                     enterprise-grade conversational system to deliver an effective and
                     efficient user experience involves a delicate orchestration between
                     technologies and personnel. From right-sizing the use cases to
                     designing an efficient dialog management for those use cases,
                     customizing the conversational technologies and evolving the system
                     for enterprise business, the success of a conversational system
                     requires a judicious balance of several metrics, often along competing
                     dimensions. In this talk, I will highlight the complexity of building
                     an enterprise-grade conversational system, and the need for a unified success metric.
